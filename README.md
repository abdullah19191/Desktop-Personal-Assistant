<h4>The main goal behind creating the “Jarvis Interface” was to allow the user to perform the daily essential tasks 
which needs the user to take some time form his/her daily activities.- Performing these tasks takes time and are frustrating 
if you’re having to take time out while you are specially doing something important or something which requires concentration example 
of these tasks can be  checking your email, checking the weather, checking if there are any meeting scheduled today etc. 
All of these activities can now be done by simply saying.It is a completely Responsive Personal Assistant just like Siri of Apple or Google Assistant!
This application uses System.Recognition & System.Syntisizer For it to achieve a response just link Siri.It has many Features in<br> it including libraries which are used for some specific tasks</h4>

## The Main Features Of Desktop Interface : 
1.	Text Reader:  -
The text reader function allows “Jarvis Interface” to read the selected text which has been selected or predesignated by the user. This feature enables the user to listen to the selected text which would be narrated to the user by “Jarvis Interface”.
This feature is especially useful is the user is trying to listen to a document or some matter of urgency while he is driving and the user can now easily listen to the part the user has selected via the Jarvis interface.



2.	Weather Forecast: -
With the help of the Jarvis Interface the user can now easily check the
Weather with the help of  a signal Command to the Jarvis Interface like,
